#This file shows the process of making a release of the Jirafe plugin for Magento

# Update the version to 0.1.6 in the following files:

app/code/community/Fooman/Jirafe/etc/config.xml

# Go to the root directory of Jirafe for Magento Plugin
cd ~/code/jirafe/magento-plugin

# Ensure all code is checked into github
git status

# Code review any changes
git diff

# Check in all changes
git commit app -m 'Updating code for v0.1.6'
git push origin master

# Tag version in github
git tag -a v0.1.6 -m 'Tagging Version 0.1.6'

# Place all required files within Magento test environment

# Add Fooman_Jirafe.xml file into the var/pear directory
cp app/etc/modules/Fooman_Jirafe.xml var/pear

# In Magento go to System > Magento Connect > Package Extensions
http://magento.local/1.4.2/index.php/admin/

# Open tab Load local Package and choose Fooman_Jirafe

# Make necessary changes on other tabs (most often Release Info is the only one requiring a change to the version number and notes)
